        <p>Protecting the oceans, one algorithm at a time.</p>
        <p class="home-info">
            Oceans cover 71% of the Earth’s surface, playing a crucial role in regulating climate, supporting biodiversity, and providing resources like food and energy. They are the lifeblood of our planet, helping to stabilize global temperatures and provide oxygen through marine life.
        </p>
        <p class="home-info">
            Oceans are home to 80% of the world’s species, supporting a diverse range of life forms. They also provide food, minerals, and energy resources, benefiting global economies.
        </p>
        <p class="home-info">
            However, oceans are increasingly polluted, with plastic waste being one of the most significant threats. Every year, millions of tons of plastic end up in the sea, harming marine life and ecosystems. The problem also contributes to microplastic pollution, affecting the food chain.
